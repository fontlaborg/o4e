NEXT TASK: Sprint forward to complete the development as outlined in @./PLAN.md and @./TODO.md . Use the file @./WORK.md as the scratchpad for notes, but clean these files once you’ve completed a task, and also check off the completed tasks in @./PLAN.md and @./TODO.md ;; NOTE: '@' denotes the start of a path but is not itself part of a path) ;; NOTE: KEEP this NEXTTASK.md file as is, DON’T CHANGE IT! ;;
